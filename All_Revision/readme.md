React Practical Questions

1. 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁:
Create a pagination component for a list of items fetched from an API. Handle scenarios where the user navigates between pages, and ensure the data is displayed correctly.

2. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗮 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿:
Build a search filter for a list of items, such as a list of products or contacts. The filter should update the displayed items based on the search input in real-time.

3. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
Implement a basic chat application using React. The app should allow multiple users to send and receive messages in real-time, updating the UI accordingly.

4. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁:
Develop a reusable modal component that can be triggered by various buttons or links. The modal should handle different content types and have a close button to dismiss it.

5. 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗻 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗟𝗮𝘇𝘆 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Build an image gallery that loads images as the user scrolls down the page (lazy loading). Optimize the app for performance, ensuring smooth scrolling and fast loading times.

6. 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽 𝗮 𝗗𝗿𝗮𝗴-𝗮𝗻𝗱-𝗗𝗿𝗼𝗽 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲:
Create a drag-and-drop interface where users can reorder a list of items or drag items between different lists. Ensure that the UI updates correctly based on the user's interactions.

7. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗦𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Implement a product list that allows users to sort products by price, rating, etc., and apply filters based on categories, price range, or availability.

8. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗡𝗮𝘃𝗯𝗮𝗿:
Design a responsive navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes. Include a hamburger menu for mobile views and ensure smooth transitions between different states.

9. 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁:
Build a list that loads more items as the user scrolls down, implementing infinite scrolling. Ensure the data fetching is optimized and that the UI does not freeze during loading.

10. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁:
Develop a notifications component that displays real-time alerts or messages to the user. The notifications should appear dynamically, with options to dismiss or interact with them.
